import PlaygroundPreview from '../../../components/Playground';
import TabsLayout from './tabs.mdx';

export default ({ children, pageContext }) => <TabsLayout pageContext={pageContext}>{children}</TabsLayout>;

## Usage

Preferred way enable keyboard navigation is to use the hook `useKeyboardNavigation`. The `KeyboardNavigation` component uses it and both use same properties. The component adds an extra div, which the hook does not add.

### Example

<PlaygroundPreview>
  <KeyboardNavigation>
    <ul style={{
      listStyle: 'none',
      display: 'flex',
      border: '1px solid #000',
      padding: '0',
      position: 'relative',
    }}>
      <li style={{padding: '10px'}}>
        <a href="#" tabindex="0">
          Item 1
        </a>
      </li>
      <li style={{padding: '10px'}}>
        <a href="#" tabindex="0">
          Item 2
        </a>
      </li>
      <li style={{padding: '10px'}}>
        <a href="#" tabindex="0">
          Item 3
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </KeyboardNavigation>
</PlaygroundPreview>

### Principles

- Keyboard navigation should not prevent native keyboard commands.
- If natively unfocusable element is included by the selectors, the element will be modified to accept focus.
- Elements not visible on screen are filtered out. Their bounding box must be inside the screen.

### Functionalities
- **Focusable elements:** By default all `<a>` elements inside the element passed to the component are selected as focusables
- **Container elements:** By default the passed root element is the only container of focusable elements. Multiple containers need to be used only, if you have multi-level navigation with menus and submenus and may submenus of submenus. There is no limit how deep the navigational tree can be.

### Selectors

There are two kind of selectors: `focusableSelector` and `containerSelector`. Selector can be a function or a string. Both selectors are optional.

### Function selectors

If selector is a function, it receives two arguments: 
- parent element. Usually the passed root element. In multilevel navigation, the parent element changes on each level.
- path to the parent element. Path is an array of objects and it shows where in the navigational tree the parent element is.

### String selectors
String selectors are used with `container.querySelectorAll(selector)`. The `container` is the parent element, usually root element passed to the component or hook.

### The focusableSelector
Focusable elements are queried with `container.querySelectorAll(selector)`. Default selector is `a`.

### The containerSelector
If multiple containers are needed, set the `containerSelector` property. Otherwise there is no need for it. Container elements are also queried with `container.querySelectorAll(selector)`.

### Focusable elements
You can select any element to be focusable. `tabindex` attribute is set to `-1`, if element is not natively focusable. Note that by default Firefox and Safari on Mac do not allow keyboard focus even then. System preferences must be changed.

### Container elements
Container contains any number of focusables. All focusables in sibling containers are considered to be on same level.
For example all `<li>` elements of a `<ul>` can be containers and each `<a>` in each list element can be navigated on the same level.

### Multilevel containers
If the `<li>` element also has a `<div>` as a subMenu container and it has `<span>` elements as focusables, then you should use following selectors:
- containerSelector: `:scope > ul > li, :scope > div`
- focusableSelector: `:scope a, :scope span`

`:scope` should be used to limit selectors to certain level.
